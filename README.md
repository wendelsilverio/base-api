# base-api

This architecture leverages the best open source tools and practices to build a robust, secure, and high-performance API platform. By incorporating caching, reporting, file management, and frontend hosting, it ensures a comprehensive solution for various application needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Go (Golang) - chosen for its performance, concurrency support, and robustness.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - for its reliability, scalability, and open source nature.
- **Authentication**: Keycloak - an open source identity and access management solution.
- **API Gateway**: Kong - an open source API gateway for managing, monitoring, and securing APIs.
- **Containerization**: Docker - for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes - for managing containerized applications at scale.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions - for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana - for monitoring and visualizing system performance.
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) - for centralized logging and analysis.
- **Caching**: Redis - for in-memory data caching to improve performance.
- **Reporting**: Docxtemplater - for generating reports from Word templates.
- **File and Image Management**: MinIO - for managing and storing files and images.
- **Frontend Hosting**: Nginx - for serving static frontend files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/wendelsilverio/base-api.git
    cd base-api
    ```

2. Install Docker by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

3. Set up the development environment with Docker:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

5. Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

## üöÄ Deployment

- **Environment**: On-premise or hybrid (optional cloud integration)
- **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-Green Deployment or Rolling Updates for zero-downtime deployments.

## üîí Security

- **Best Practices**: Regular security audits, use of TLS for data in transit, encryption for data at rest, secure coding practices, and regular updates to dependencies.

## üìà Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Kubernetes to scale application components horizontally based on load.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Optimize resource allocation for individual components.
